# -Vimrc-configuration
This configuration best works for  those who started programming and want to use vim as their text editor , absolutely minimum setup for startup and auto complete for major programming languages
this config is just to give you startup in windows 10 if you don;t want to spend too much time to just configure it
you have to install plug first

please choose an IDE like VisualStudio or a code editor like VisualStudio code for working on larger projects like django 
Thank you
